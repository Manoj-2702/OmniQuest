## Description:
- `OpenAI GPT-4o model` is used for creating a `RAG application` using `Object Vector Database`.
- GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.
